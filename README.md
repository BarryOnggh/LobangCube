# LobangCube

This is a hackathon project for BuildingBloCS June 2024.

LobangCube takes in your (i) age, (ii) housing type, (iii) total CPF balance, (iv) yearly income, (v) yearly expenditure, and (vi) savings, and it will show you 3 different metrics (i) Quality of Life, (ii) Disaster Preparedness, and (iii) Retirement Readiness.

We will show you an aggregate score out of a 100, give you suggestions on how to improve your metrics, and we will show you a projection of the metrics against your age.
